This project creates a MIPS simulator in which the simulator will read binary files containing a MIPS program and those programs will be executed.
It is written in Java and reads in binary files and converts them to assembly code for the MIPS program. 
There is an instruction class which uses the information in the binary files to convert them into assembly code.
Then the main function uses the instruction class to access the opcode, register files, immediate values, and others things from the assembly code.
For the second part of the program, a simulation is executed and outputs the contents of all registers and memory.

To run the code, you must compile and run it in a Java compiler
